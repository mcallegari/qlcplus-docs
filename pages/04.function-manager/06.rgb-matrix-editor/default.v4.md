The RGB matrix editor, as its name suggests, is used to edit ![](/basics/rgbmatrix.png) [RGB matrix](/basics/glossary-and-concepts#rgb-matrix) functions. The function works on predefined ![](/basics/group.png) [Fixture Groups](/basics/glossary-and-concepts#fixture-group) created by the user with the ![](/basics/fixture.png) [Fixture Manager](/fixture-manager).

Controls
--------

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **RGB matrix name** | Change the name of the RGB matrix. |
| ![](/basics/speed.png) | Adjust the RGB Matrix speed settings:<br><br>**Fade In:** The time it takes for the fixtures in the RGB Matrix fixture group to fade their intensity channels up<br>**Fade Out:** The time it takes for the fixtures in the RGB Matrix fixture group to fade their intensity channels back to zero<br>**Duration:** The duration of each step of the selected pattern |
| ![](/basics/sequence.png) | Convert the current RGB Matrix into a [Sequence](/basics/glossary-and-concepts#sequence). This is useful to speed up the creation of a [Show](/basics/glossary-and-concepts#show). Please note that if the selected pattern generates random data, this functionality will generate a different Sequence every time. |
| ![](/basics/square.png) | Switch the preview mode between circles and squares |
| ![](/basics/player_play.png) | Make the RGB Matrix run as if it were started from a [Virtual Console](/virtual-console) button. Note that the preview stops while the function is running. |
| **Fixture group** | The [Fixture Group](/basics/glossary-and-concepts#fixture-group) that is controlled by this RGB matrix. |
| **Preview area** | Shows a preview of the currently selected pattern imposed on the fixtures defined in the currently selected fixture group. Note that the preview doesn't show the difference between RGB-capable and monochrome/fixed color fixtures. |
| **Pattern** | Select the pattern and colors that are used on the selected fixture group for drawing graphics.  <br>Patterns can be:<br><br>**Plain Color**: all the pixels of the matrix will be lit to the selected color<br>  <br>**Animated Text**: display an animated text with the following parameters:<br> *Text*: The text edit field is used to edit the text content that is scrolled/flashed on the matrix.<br>*Font*: The font button ![](/basics/fonts.png) is used to select the font (tip: bitmap fonts work best)<br>*Animation*: The drop-down box is used to select the animation style (Horizontal, Vertical or Letters)<br>  <br>**Audio Spectrum**: QLC+ will start capturing data from the chosen audio input device and will represent the audio spectrum as vertical bars in the RGB Matrix with the selected start and end color.  <br>    For an optimal usage of this pattern, the hold time of the Matrix must be set to a reasonably low value (e.g. .20)<br>  <br>**Image**: display an image loaded from a file, with the following parameters:<br>    <br>    *Path*: The text edit field is used to edit the image filename<br>*Image*: The image button ![](/basics/image.png) is used to load an image from file<br>*Animation*: The drop-down box is used to select the animation style (Static, Horizontal, Vertical or Animation)<br>    <br>    Supported formats: PNG, XPM, JPG, GIF (for animated gifs only first frame is used).<br>    <br>    Styles:<br>    <br>**Static** \- the image is statically displayed on the matrix. If the image is smaller than the matrix, it is repeated in both directions. (Tip: for stripes, use 1-point-high images)<br>**Horizontal** \- the image is scrolled horizontaly. Again, image is repeated in both directions.<br>**Vertical** \- same as **Horizontal**, but in vertical direction.<br>**Animation** \- play animation. Stack the frames (of width equal to matrix's) side by side in one image. For example, when matrix is 8x8 and you want to have 4 frames, make image 32x8. The image is still repeated vertically.<br>  <br>The rest of the pattern list is filled with [RGB Scripts](/basics/glossary-and-concepts#rgb-script) loaded when QLC+ starts up.  <br>Depending on the selected pattern, it is possible to choose a start and an end color. Some patterns do not allow colors at all (since they elapse them autonomously) or allow just one color. |
| **Pattern Blend Mode** | The blend mode is the mechanism used to mix multiple RGB Matrices running one on top of the other.  <br>Here's a representation of how it works:<br><br>![](blending.png)<br><br>The matrix running on the bottom layer must use the default mode, to prepare a ground of colors that all the above layers can use to perform blending. |
| **Pattern Color Mode** | The color mode is the mechanism select which color channels the RGB Matrices applies to.  <br>Default setting is RGB mode, addressing RGB channels or CMY channels. If set otherwise, only the selected channels (e.g. "White") whill be set in a grayscale of the selected color(s). Channels not representing the selected color mode (e.g. R, G and B) will not be touched. |
| **Offset** | Available only when **Text** or **Image** is the selected pattern.<br><br>**X:** Used to shift the pattern along the horizontal x-axis (negative values go to the left, positive values go to the right)<br>**Y:** Used to shift the pattern along the vertical y-axis (negative values go up, positive values go down) |
| **Run Order** | **Loop:** Run through the steps over and over again.<br>**Single Shot:** Run through the steps once and then stop.<br>**Ping Pong:** Run through the steps over and over again, reversing direction at both ends. |
| **Direction** | **Forward:** Run through the steps from start to end; 1, 2, 3...<br>**Backward:** Run through the steps from end to start; ...3, 2, 1 |
| **Control Mode** | This selects the channels which the RGB Matrix uses as output. For example: You can use the "Dimmer" option to allow the matrix to control dimmer channels for the fixtures in the group.  |

### Chapter 2

# Main Window

The QLC+ Main Window consists of three main parts:

1.  A Menu bar containing buttons for global functions
2.  Active panels selected by their respective tabs
3.  Tabs that allow the selection of one of the QLC+ panels

Most of the controls throughout the software have tooltips, which pop up after holding your mouse cursor over them for a short while.

### Panel Tabs (3)
--------------

At the bottom of main window you can find easy eye catching icons for switching between QLC+ contexts.  
By double clicking on a tab, **a context can be detached on a separate window**. To reattach a detached context, just close the window.  
QLC+ contexts appear in the following order (from left to right):

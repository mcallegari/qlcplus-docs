The colors, font, frame style, stacking order, size and placement of widgets can be changed to better suit your vision of the perfect lighting console. Most of these options, except for moving and resizing, are available in the Virtual Console **Edit** menu, that is, they can be accessed from the menu bar as well as from a popup menu by right clicking a widget you wish to adjust.

**NOTE:** The Virtual Console widgets' styling and placement options are available only when the application is in [Design Mode](concept.html#Modes).

### Moving Widgets

Widgets can be moved simply by dragging them as if you were dragging any icon on your desktop. Refer to your operating system manual on how to drag items.

To move a widget from one frame to another frame, you need to move the widget through the Virtual Console clipboard. Cut the widgets from the first frame, then select another frame and paste the widgets into that frame.

### Resizing Widgets

Each widget has a special resize handle ![](qrc:/resize.png) on their lower right hand corner that you can grab and then resize the widget as appropriate simply by dragging the handle.

### Widget Background

To change a widget's background color, choose **Color** from the **Background** menu and select a color from the popup dialog. To set an image as the widget's background, choose **Image** from the **Background** menu and select an image file from the popup dialog.

To restore the default background color (and to clear an image), choose **Default** from the **Background** menu.

**NOTE:** Some operating systems and/or visual themes do not allow manual setting of background colors or images. Try changing the desktop theme if you encounter this problem.

### Widget Foreground

To change a widget's foreground color, choose **Color** from the **Foreground** menu and select a color from the popup dialog.

Buttons can have an icon in the foreground, which will override any text set as their name. To change a button's icon, select **Choose...** from the **Icon** menu and select an image file from the popup dialog.

To restore the default background color (and to clear an icon if applicable), choose **Default** from the **Background** menu.

**NOTE:** Some operating systems and/or visual themes do not allow manual setting of foreground colors or images. Try changing the desktop theme if you encounter this problem.

### Widget Borders

To change the border style for a widget, you can choose either **Raised** or **Sunken** from the **Border** menu. To completely remove the borders of a widget, choose **None** from the **Border** menu.

**NOTE:** Some operating systems and/or visual themes do not allow manual setting of borders. Try changing the desktop theme if you encounter this problem.

### Fonts

You can change the font for all child widgets of a frame at the same time by changing the font of the frame itself. Alternatively, you can change the font for each widget separately. Fonts can be changed by selecting **Font...** from the **Font** menu. To restore the font back to the widget's parent frame's font, select **Default** from the **Font** menu.

### Widget Stacking Order

In addition to the normal 2-dimensions, vertical and horizontal, you can also adjust widgets' placement in the 3rd dimension: depth. If you see a widget going behind another control, you can **raise** the widget on top of all other widgets by selecting **Raise** from the **Stacking Order** menu. Likewise, if you wish to put a widget behind all other widgets, you can select **Lower** from the **Stacking Order** menu.

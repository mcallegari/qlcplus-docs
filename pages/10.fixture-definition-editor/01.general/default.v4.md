| --- | --- |
| **Manufacturer** | The fixture's manufacturer name. For example "FooCompany". Please note that if you're adding a definition of a manufacturer already present in the QLC+ library, you should adopt the same exact name adopted by the other creators. For example, "IMG Stageline" is not "img stageline" or "IMG-Stageline" |
| **Model** | The fixture's model name. For example "FooZapper 2000". Please stick to the product manual to fill in this information. No need to specify the LED configuration like "PAR64 MKII 8x1W LED RGBWAUV USB". It's just "PAR64 MKII" |
| **Type** | The fixture's category type. For an accurate preview, it is important to fill in the proper category. For example, while a moving head is most likely a color changer too, the type should be set to "Moving Head" |
| **Author** | The fixture definition author name. Please do not submit email addresses or references to some website. They will be removed anyway during review. |

This is the section where the _global_ physical information of the fixture is provided.  
An identical section is also present in each mode, in case the fixture allows its physical properties (e.g. pan/tilt range) to be altered depending on the mode. In that case, the global physical information can be overridden by _per-mode_ physical information.

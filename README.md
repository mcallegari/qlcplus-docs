# QLC+ Official Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation repository for [qlcplus.org](https://qlcplus.org/)!

## How does it work?

The [qlcplus.org](qlcplus.org) website uses the [Grav](https://getgrav.org/) content management system (CMS). Using a customized version of the Grav Learn2 theme, Learn2 with Git Sync is designed to help collaboratively edit Markdown-based documentation.

When changes are made to this git repository the [docs.qlcplus.org](https://docs.qlcplus.org/) site automatically updates with the changes.
